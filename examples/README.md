This directory contains some sample movies of fracture dissolution from
dissolFoam simulations.

2seed.ogv: An initially flat fracture with two small perturbations near
the inlet. The flow is driven by a constant pressure drop.

random.ogv: An initially flat fracture with small perturbations imposed
on the surface positions. Here the flow is restricted to a maximum of
50 times the initial flow rate.

ellcyl: A dissolving elliptical cylinder - constant flow rate
